# 🏥 **Hospital Information Management System (HIMS)**

---

## 📘 **Overview**  
**Hospital Information Management System (HIMS)** is a database-driven project designed to efficiently manage hospital operations, including patient records, staff details, appointments, and access rights. The system ensures secure data handling, easy retrieval, and smooth hospital workflow management.

## ⚙️ **Features**  
- 🧑‍⚕️ **Patient Management:** Store and manage patient information including demographics, medical history, and visits.  
- 🏥 **Staff & Department Records:** Maintain structured data for hospital staff, their roles, and assigned departments.  
- 📅 **Appointment Scheduling:** Record patient appointments and doctor allocations for efficient hospital scheduling.  
- 🔐 **Access Rights Control:** Assign and restrict user privileges to ensure secure system access.  
- 📂 **Data Integrity:** Enforced relationships and constraints maintain accuracy and prevent redundancy.

## 🗄️ **Database Structure**  
The **HIMS** database includes several key tables:  
- **Patients** – Stores details of registered patients.  
- **Doctors** – Contains information about doctors and their specializations.  
- **Departments** – Manages hospital departments.  
- **Appointments** – Tracks patient-doctor appointments.  
- **AccessRights** – Defines user permissions for the system.  
- **Users** – Stores login and authentication data.

## 🧩 **Technologies Used**  
- **SQL Server / MySQL Workbench** – Database design and implementation  
- **ER Diagram (EER Model)** – Visual representation of relationships  
- **Stored Procedures & Constraints** – For secure and efficient operations  

---

## 🧠 **Learning Outcome**  
This project helped in understanding:
- **Database design principles**  
- **Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling**  
- **Implementation of normalization and constraints**  
- **Real-world use of SQL commands and triggers** for data management
